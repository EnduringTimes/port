# Menes' Portfolio README

Welcome! This is where you'll find the behind-the-scenes of my personal portfolio. I'm Menes, coming to you from the ever-surprising Michigan. This portfolio is a collection of my steps into the coding world.

## Overview

This repo includes a couple of main sections:

- **About Me:** Dive into who I am, my coding journey, and a bit about life in Michigan.
- **Projects:** Take a look at my first projects, a site makeover, and this portfolio itself. It's a glimpse into my progress and experiments.
- **Contact:** All the ways you can reach out to me.

### Technologies

The site's built on HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for that extra flair, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.

## Feedback?

I'm always open to feedback or a good chat. Feel free to drop me a line through GitHub, LinkedIn, or email, all listed on the portfolio site.

## What's Next

This portfolio is a living document of my journey. I'm always adding new stuff and refining old projects. Keep an eye out for updates!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting!
